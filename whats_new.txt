*Version 1.9.0 RC 02* Released 27th Nov 2020

*General user changes*
- Added command `what's new` that will show this.
- Added option to start a `repl` without pre-executing '.mart-bot-repl' source code in case exists. Just add `clean` before the `repl` command. For example: `clean repl Example`

------------------------------
*Admin user changes*
- `Bot stats` now shows the top 10 users and attaches the full list of users and commands.
- Now the routines are displayed as routine/USER
- It is possible to exclude routines from results when using `bot stats`
- When creating routines now it is possible to publish in a different channel: `add routine run_tests at 17:05 #thechannel !run api tests`
