*Version 1.9.0 RC 09* Released 2021-Jan-20

*For General users*
- Added command `what's new` that will show this.
- Possible to create 'global' shortcuts that will be available on any SmartBot Channel.
- Added option to start a `repl` without pre-executing '.smart-bot-repl' source code in case exists. Just add `clean` before the `repl` command. For example: `clean repl Example`
- When using `Ruby` command in case the process doesn't finish in 20 seconds will be aborted.
- When creating rules/commands and asking a question now you can use 'answer' instead of '@questions'. Take a look at README.md for an example.
- Using external calls, it is possible to send to more than one bot channel the same rule: `@smart-bot on #channel1 #channel2 #channel3 echo Lala`
- `bot help` and `bot rules` return by default a short version of the commands. Call `bot help expanded` or `bot rules expanded` to get a full desciption of the commands.
------------------------------
*For Admin users*
- `Bot stats` now shows the top 10 users and attaches the full list of users and commands.
- Now the routines are displayed as routine/USER
- It is possible to exclude routines from results when using `bot stats`
- When creating routines now it is possible to publish in a different channel: `add routine run_tests at 17:05 #thechannel !run api tests`
