*Version 1.12.0* Released 2022-Sep-28

*For General users*
- `run repl` accepts local parameters and precode to be supplied (<https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/60|#60>).
- `!!run repl` will respond as soon as any result is released (<https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/63|#63>)
- Now you can add notes for the team, even you can specify if those notes are private so only the members of the team can see them, or even personal. You can use different types of notes: memo, note, issue, task, feature, bug. Also you can indicate the topic of the note. To be able to add or delete notes you need to be a member of that team. Example: `add private bug to Moon team SRE : Logs should not be accessible from outside VPN` (<https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/64|#64> <https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/67|#67>)

- `kill repl RUN_REPL_ID` Will kill a running repl previously executed with `run repl` command. (<https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/69|#69>)

- It is possible to add the status of a memo on teams feature. (<https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot/issues/72|#72>)
