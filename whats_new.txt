*Version 1.10.0-DEV32* Released 2021-Aug-09

*For General users*
- When on a private conversation with the SmartBot (DM) and not using any channels rule on the conversation, the general_rules will be available.
- On DM with the SmartBot if you want to use a rule from a specific channel you can use also: `#CHANNEL RULE` or `on #CHANNEL RULE`. For example: `#sales get report for India` 
- Now when using general commands, the SmartBot will be responding on any channel where is a member, even though is not listening to you. For example: `clear screen`
- Added command `suggest command` that will return the help content for a random command.
- New command `leaderboard` returns useful information about the use of the SmartBot.
- `add COLOR announcement MESSAGE`, `add EMOJI announcement MESSAGE` command stores the message on the announcement list labeled with the color/emoji specified, white by default. Aliases for announcement: statement, declaration, message. Related: `see announcements`, `delete announcement id`
- `hi bot` and `bye bot` can be called from any channel where the SmartBot is a member.
- Added general command `see statuses`, `who is on vacation?`, `who is not on vacation?`
- New general command `see favorite commands`. It will display the favorite commands in that channel. 

*For Admin users*
- respond_thread method will send the respond creating a thread if necessary. It can be used also `respond 'msg', :on_thread`
- `respond 'msg', :direct` will send a direct message to the person that is executing the rule.
- You can add general commands that will be responding on any channel where the Smart Bot is a member even though is not 'listening to you'. Add them to '/rules/general_commands.rb
- when using `respond` you can supply two options: unfurl_links and unfurl_media. By default is a boolean: true
- added option 'weekdays' and 'weekends' for `create routine` command, for example: `add silent routine suggestions on weekdays at 09:00 suggest command`
- Added a new config for the SmartBot to log all RTM communication, admits `true` or `false`, by default `false`: `logrtm`
- Use the command `send message to` and `react to` to impersonate the SmartBot. Only accessible for Master Admins on a DM with the SmartBot.
- New command to see the result of the last run of a routine: `see result routine NAME`
- Now it is possible to create *bgroutine* then the results of the routine run won't be published.
- To display a general message after every command use: `set general message MESSAGE`. Use `set general message off` to stop displaying it.
- When adding a general message is possible to use interpolation
- If you are a master admin and you are on master channel then you can call `publish announcements` that will publish the announcements on all channels. The messages stored on a DM won't be published. This is very convenient to be called from a *Routine* for example every weekday at 09:00.
- Now it is possible to send blocks `respond blocks: my_blocks`. More info about blocks: https://api.slack.com/block-kit
- When using bgroutines if we want to avoid a file to be sent: 
        send_file(dest, 'description', "file_path", 'desc', 'text/plain', "text") unless Thread.current[:routine_type] == 'bgroutine'
